## Awesome Cocoa only apps written in mainly Objective C (well worth a try to port them to GNUstep)

These should be sorted further to decide whether they have dependencies which can be ported as well or should be replaced (like `carbon.h`). Swift code may be upgraded to ObjC. ;-)

## Great Cocoa/GNUstep based app ideas that should be developed further (and/or ported)

- [NeoOffice](https://github.com/neooffice/NeoOffice)
- [OpenOutliner](https://github.com/davidchisnall/OpenOutliner) - strongly needed replacement for OmniOutliner (proprietary)
- [SimpleAgenda](https://github.com/poroussel/simpleagenda) - strongly needed replacement for 2Do.app and BusyCal (proprietary)
