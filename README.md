# Open Source Objective-C

These lists focus on simple solutions that are portable or could potentially be used as code base for portable code.

Portable code means code either compatible with [GNUstep](https://github.com/gnustep/) or [ObjFW](https://github.com/objfw/) (recommended).

## iOS / iPhone, iPad OS / CocoaTouch Apps

- [Mumble](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-iphoneos)

## iOS Libs

- [Couchbase Lite iOS](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios)
- [FCModel](https://github.com/marcoarment/FCModel) - An alternative to Core Data for people who like having direct SQL access
- [FMDB](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb) - A Cocoa / Objective-C wrapper around SQLite
- [MumbleKit](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumblekit)

## ObjFW Libs

See https://github.com/objfw and https://objfw.nil.im/wiki?name=Third-party+Libraries&p

## Open Source Cocoa libs

- [AJR Database](https://github.com/tdmartin102/ajrdatabase) - JAEOF: "Just Another EOF"

## Cross platform apps using AppKit (GNUstep GUI apps)

- [Cenon](http://www.cenon.info/)
- [FisicaLab](https://www.gnu.org/software/fisicalab/)
- [GNUMail](http://www.nongnu.org/gnustep-nonfsf/gnumail/index.html)
- [Grr (GÃ¼nther's Rss Reader)](http://www.nongnu.org/gap/grr/index.html)
- [PikoPixel](http://twilightedge.com/mac/pikopixel/)


## Cross platform Objective-C software not using AppKit

- [Oolite](https://github.com/OoliteProject/oolite)
- [SOGo](https://github.com/inverse-inc/sogo)


## Awesome Cocoa only apps written in mainly Objective-C (well worth a try to port them to GNUstep or ObjFW)

These should be sorted further to decide whether they have dependencies which can be ported as well or should be replaced (like `carbon.h`). Swift code may be upgraded to ObjC. ;-)

## Great Cocoa/GNUstep based app ideas that should be developed further (and/or ported)

- [NeoOffice](https://github.com/neooffice/NeoOffice)
- [OpenOutliner](https://github.com/davidchisnall/OpenOutliner) - strongly needed replacement for OmniOutliner (proprietary)
- [SimpleAgenda](https://github.com/poroussel/simpleagenda) - strongly needed replacement for 2Do.app and BusyCal (proprietary)


## Stuff people probably don't use anymore

- [svnX](https://github.com/grimmer0125/svnX)
